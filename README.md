ChatGPT Clone with OpenAI API Integration

Welcome to the ChatGPT Clone repository! This project is a simple yet powerful implementation of a chatbot using the OpenAI API. With this clone, you can build and run your own chatbot that leverages the capabilities of OpenAI's powerful language model, GPT-3.5.

Features:

Realistic Conversations: Engage in natural and dynamic conversations with the chatbot. The model generates coherent and contextually relevant responses, mimicking human-like interaction.

Easy API Integration: Simply provide your OpenAI API key, and you're ready to go. The code handles the communication with the OpenAI API, making it hassle-free to set up.

Customizable Interaction: Modify the code to adapt the chatbot to your specific use case. You can define the conversation prompts and responses according to your needs.

Getting Started:

Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ChatGPT-Clone.git.

Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

OpenAI API Key: Obtain your OpenAI API key from the OpenAI website if you haven't already.

API Key Configuration: In the main.py file, replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual OpenAI API key.

Run the Chatbot: Run the chatbot using python main.py. You can now interact with your chatbot by typing messages and receiving responses.
